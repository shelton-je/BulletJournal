4) You can run the application by either double-clicking on the JAR file or by using the terminal (or command prompt):
- To run using double-click, simply double-click on the JAR file. 
The application should start running if your system is set up to run JAR files with the Java Runtime Environment.

- If you wish to use the terminal (or command prompt), first open it.

- Change the directory to where the JAR file is located. For instance, 
if you saved the file in your Downloads folder, type cd Downloads.

- Once you're in the correct directory, type java -jar pa05-template.jar to start the application..

Enjoy using the application!
